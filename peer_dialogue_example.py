Peer Dialogue Generation with PyETR
====================================

This example demonstrates how to use PyETR to model and generate dialogue 
between two reasoning peers using the Erotetic Theory of Reasoning.

The key insight is that dialogue emerges from:
1. Each peer having their own view (beliefs + questions)
2. Peers sharing information through view operations
3. Questions driving the conversation forward
4. Reasoning operations updating beliefs

We'll model a conversation between Alice and Bob about a shared scenario.
